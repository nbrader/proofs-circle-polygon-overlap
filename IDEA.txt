Can we simplify the logic to be entirely in terms of drawing triangles to the centre of the circle for every part of the square perimeter inside the circle and drawing circular sectors to the centre of the circle for every circular arc inside the square?

You're meant to establish which segments and arcs to consider by finding all intersections and square points that fit on or in the circle, connect the parts of segments interior to the circle using those arcs to build the shape of the intersection of their interiors and then do the previously mentioned decomposition into sectors and triangles, making sure to use signed area in order to deduct negatives correctly.
