// Verified: matches implemented overlap logic (polygon fully inside -> polygon triangles; circle fully inside -> full circle primitive; intersection -> alternating lines and arcs, no consecutive arcs, arcs chosen by clockwise circle order and inside-polygon midpoints).

The polygon will either be:
1. Completely enclosed in the circle: algorithm traces the entire polygon as triangles in the order they occur
2. Circle entirely enclosed in the polygon: overlap is the full circle (special case using circle primitive instead of sectors/triangles)
3. Polygon intersects the circle: boundary of overlap is a set of continuous chains of arcs and line segments with multiple consecutive line segments possible within a component but never multiple consecutive arcs. A polygon vertex is only considered to intersect a circle if the incoming and outgoing edges are on different sides of the circle perimeter. There should always be a way to return to a chain of line segments via a clockwise journey around the circle to the next intersection between circle and polygon.

Known Issues to Address:
- Point 1: Circle-fully-inside/outside detection currently uses 8-point sampling which is unreliable and causes numerical spikes. Need exact geometric tests:
  * Circle fully inside polygon: center inside polygon AND all edges farther than radius from center
  * No overlap: center outside polygon AND all vertices farther than radius from center
- Point 2: Insufficient epsilon tolerance throughout calculations may cause edge-case misclassifications
